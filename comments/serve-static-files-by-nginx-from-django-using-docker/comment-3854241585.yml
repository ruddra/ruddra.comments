comment: "I notice your docker-compose.yml has version:2. I was trying to follow this with version:3, and I was getting errors of

<pre>'Mounts denied: rnThe path /staticrnis not shared from OS X and is not known to Docker.rnYou can configure shared paths from Docker -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; File Sharing'<br/></pre>

I ended up changing my docker-compose.yml to use a top-level named volume. So, instead of putting in  

<pre> - /static:/static<br/></pre>

  
in web and nginx, I put in  

<pre> - static-volume:/static<br/></pre>

  
And at the end of the docker-compose.yml file, I added  

<pre>volumes:<br/>  static-volume:<br/></pre>

And it all worked!

Thanks for the great tutorials!"
