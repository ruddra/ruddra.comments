comment: "Please excuse my n00bness in advance.\r\nI followed the steps up until step 7, when I get the following error: \r\n\r\nThere was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pypi.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /simple/pycrypto/ (Caused by SSLError(\"Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.\")) - skipping\r\n\r\nAlso, my jupyter notebooks don't work now.  I won't distract from my main question with that error at this time though.\r\nThank you for posting this fix, and hopefully someone can help me fix the fix."
