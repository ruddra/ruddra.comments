  I think either you did not install `mysql-connector-c` or installed a
  versioned package such as `mysql-connector-c@version-number`. In the first,
  please see if you have installed the connector, otherwise install it using
  brew. For the second case, I think this Stack Overflow answer might help:
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/54367240/2696165. If neither of them helps, then I
  suggest clean up the system by uninstalling and pruning
  mysql/mysql-connector-c and initiate the mysql installation process from the
  beginning. This Stack Overflow answer might help regarding cleanup:
