comment: "This is a good article.  A few thoughts about it as none of these answers really were able to solve my issue.\r\nMethod #2 is nice, but adds dependencies outside of a standard pip install.  This would be much more useful if the author just wrote a routine to essentially do the same without the dependencies.  Method #3 seems to be the way to go.  However, the author's description of how to use the Django Rest Framework isn't very complete.  Only a few code segments are given and a complete usable method is far from implemented."
