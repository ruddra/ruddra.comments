comment: "Not sure how this works for you. \r\nCodeBuild runs in a docker. \r\nCreating another docker from within build means the networking is \"special\". A container cannot access the network of another container by simply using \"localhost\". You have to use the actual IP address assigned to the other container.\r\n\r\nPlus, this start command:\r\ndocker run -e PGPASSWORD -e PGUSER -e PGDATABASE \r\nis invalid. The environment variables need to have a \"var=val\" definition."
