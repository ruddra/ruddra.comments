1: This does not seem to work:  

     pip install djangoencryptfile

2: Bug here?: 

```
open('readme.md', 'rb') as inputfile: 
```  

should this be:

```  
with open('readme.md', 'rb') as inputfile:
```

3: Another bug here  
```
usefile = File(inputfile, name='readme.md')  
encrypted_file = service.encrypt_file(useFile, password, extension='enc') #
```
case mismatch between usefile and useFile"
