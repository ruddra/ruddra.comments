comment: There are several things wrong here. In django, you are running the app in 8000 port, but in Nginx, you are using web:8001, which should not work. Remove static volume from docker-compose nginx service. Also for debugging purpose, access shell of both web and nginx container. Go to static directory and run \`ls\` to check if static files exists or not.
