comment: "Hi,  
I've tried to follow your tutorial and successfully build the docker project.
```
$ docker-compose start  
Starting db ... done  
Starting web ... done  
Starting nginx ... done
```
But in docker ps I only got this:  
cccd210ee314 postgres:latest 'docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦' 4 minutes ago Up 8seconds 5432/tcp ps01

Seems like only my postgres db running, and localhost:8000 is not working"
