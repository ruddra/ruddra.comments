comment: "Thanks a lot for this post, it´s much better than the official one, I am totally new on this and I have a question (maybe it´s a silly question). When you setup Django with PostgreSQL each one has to be on it´s own server or virtual machine, I am trying to setup this but I am getting errors:
```
could not connect to server Connection refused  
web_1 | Is the server running on host 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) and accepting  
web_1 | TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
```"
