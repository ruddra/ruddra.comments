comment: Hi, sorry I couldn't reply on your earlier comment. Anyways, you have go to the docker's shell and run this command. Run \`docker exec -ti web bash\` and go to the directory containing <a href="http://manage.py" rel="nofollow noopener" title="manage.py">manage.py</a> and run the migration commands. Hope it helps
