comment: 'I am using docker 3 with django 2.0.3 and I have my static files within a static folder in my app. I also have my html files in a template folder within the app directory. I used your code here as well as in your static file serving tutorial, however, I cannot seem to get the static files to be served using your code. Also using your code, I cannot seem to have nginx run as it says the port has already been allocated.

When I change the port, it just says bad gateway.

Help please.'
