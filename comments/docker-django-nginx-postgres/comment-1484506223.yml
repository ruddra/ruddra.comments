comment: "Awesome Tutorial, but I can't reach my web page. On the web logs It seems that Gunicorn is working normally.  
```
django01 | [2017-01-16 00:40:22 +0000] [9] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.6.0  
django01 | [2017-01-16 00:40:22 +0000] [9] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (9)  
django01 | [2017-01-16 00:40:22 +0000] [9] [INFO] Using worker: sync  
django01 | [2017-01-16 00:40:23 +0000] [12] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12
```
But my Nginx logs only says: Attaching to nginx01

I didn't create a /config/ folder, just created a django.conf file and in my docker-compose.yml I changed volumes to:  
volumes:  
```
 - ./src:/src  
 - ./nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d
```
Don't know whats wrong  :disappointed:"
