comment: "Hello Ruddra, I was trying to configure the django in pycharm commuity edition 2016.3 , i have tried above steps, after that how do i create fresh project using django template moreover I don't see the django template in pycharm.  
How do i achieve this in order to create a fresh project.

In case django cant be seen as template in pycharm then how do i create project files manually?"
