  I've been using tmux and neovim for several years.  Alacritty is a new one for
  me.  I seem to notice that Alacritty does *not* call `path_helper`.  This
  seems to be a distinction from how `iTerm2` operates.  The issue is that the
  path is not set properly.  Have you noticed this distinction and a solution?
