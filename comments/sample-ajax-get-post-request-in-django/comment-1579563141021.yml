comment: "The Ballad of Shirley Collins review.\r\nBuy 5, Get 2 FREE.\r\nThe result was a fascinating sequence of linked tracks that couldn t have been more different sometimes brash, sometimes subdued, sometimes dense.\r\n   http://megalsaigenuadamath.info/zip/necrobreed-benighted-necrobreed.php   One must give the band their due, of course, since only an ultra-talented musical outfit can pack their two first records to the brim with prime material - most bands would probably experience the third album factor at the stage of the first one.\r\nHowever, this does not need to be the case.\r\nMobile Fidelity puts the surrealism back into Surrealistic Pillow."
