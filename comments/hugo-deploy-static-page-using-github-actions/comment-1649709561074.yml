  I completely agree with you, on the other hand it is the same pitfall for all
  other opensource solutions. It can be a source of vulnerability or be the
  vulnerability itself. IMO, the remedy is not to stop using the solution,
  rather look into the package itself (as it is opensource) and find if there is
  any potential problems.
