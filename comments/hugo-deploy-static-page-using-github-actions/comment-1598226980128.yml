  I like the automation, but still need the local quick preview. So I keep my
  local hugo. It is started once via a powershell script, polls the local git
  repo clone, and publishes to a tmp file outside the git scope, so I won't get
  any changes into the web site repo from the local tests. In the browser I
  create a preview bookmark that points to localhost:1313. With the automated
  refresh feature from hugo, I get a near-life update of the web page. When I am
  satisfied with the work, I commit with github Desktop. Mark Text as IDE, ready
  to go even for non.techies ;)
