comment: "In My Opinion this tutorial is TOTALLY Dangerous, because you are giving an external party (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3) complete admistrative and write access to ALL your Repositories on github, because you are defining a single Token for ALL Repos.\r\n\r\nAny malfunction or hostile action or bug in peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 will be allowed to do anything to your repositories and have even access to your private repositories.\r\n\r\nI, for one, will not allow any external service a complete access to all repositories.\r\n\r\nYou can authorize deploy keys on a repo basis, which then can be allowed to push into exactly the repo they need to. This can be used by external services/gh-actions to rollout/deploy."
