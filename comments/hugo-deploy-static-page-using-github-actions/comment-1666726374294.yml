comment: "Hi thanks for the good post.\r\nI might be bit too dull, as I don't get it, should it be one and same repository for github.action or separate repository?\r\n\r\nI am just getting page not found. https://github.com/thepenguinthatwants/thepenguinthatwants.github.io/tree/main\r\n\r\nIt also created gh-pages branch. Which doesn't seem to have public folder."
